intitial:
- browse section folders
- stream music
- stream videos
- store config

Connect to your Plex Server from the local network (or through VPN). You can browse your music and video folders in "foldermode" and stream the mediafiles. (Pictures is not tested/implemented for now)
It uses the native html5 player for streaming, which stays active while browsing and is closing, when you open another file.
My initial main focus was to access and stream my music in a comfortable way.

Good to know for v0.1 (very alpha):

- when opening a video, it could take some time the video to appear
- library refresh button in settings does nothing at the moment
- full transcoding uses fix parameters: 480p, 1.5Mbit, 60% Quality
- if you hear no sound at videos you should use transcoding
- video: seek in timeline does not work, when transcoding is enabled
- tested with Plex Server Version 0.9.16.3 using plex api and bq Aquaris 4.5

More features will come.
Feedback is welcome.


TODO:
- global player in the bottom X
- alternatives to folderview (load on demand in 32-rows-packages) X
- add transcoding manual options
- settings are callable from every page X
